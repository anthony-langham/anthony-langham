I'm a product-focussed builder working at the intersection of clinical reasoning, technical systems, and scalable product.

I prototype fast, ship iteratively, and thrive in ambiguity. My work spans hands on engineering, product strategy, and clinical insight. I help teams turn messy, high-entropy problems into simple, useful tools by translating disorder into logic and turning ideas into working products. 

I design for real users and collaborate across disciplines to get things shipped.
